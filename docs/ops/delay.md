## Delay
The `DEL` delay op allow commands to be sheduled for execution after a
defined interval by placing them into a buffer which can hold up to 64 commands.
Commands can be delayed by up to 16 seconds.

In LIVE mode, the second icon (an upside-down U) will be lit up when there is
a command in the `DEL` buffer.
