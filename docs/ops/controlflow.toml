If `x` is not zero execute command

#### Advanced `IF` / `ELIF` / `ELSE` usage

  1. Intermediate statements always run

    ```text
    SCRIPT 1:
    IF 0: 0        => do nothing
    TR.P 1         => always happens
    ELSE: TR.P 2   => else branch runs because of the previous IF
    ```

  2. `ELSE` without an `IF`

    ```text
    SCRIPT 1:
    ELSE: TR.P 1   => never runs, as there is no preceding IF
    ```


  3. `ELIF` without an `IF`

    ```text
    SCRIPT 1:
    ELIF 1: TR.P 1  => never runs, as there is no preceding IF
    ```

  4. Independent scripts

    ```text
    SCRIPT 1:
    IF 1: TR.P 1    => pulse output 1

    SCRIPT 2:
    ELSE: TR.P 2    => never runs regardless of what happens in script 1
                       (see example 2)
    ```

  5. Dependent scripts

    ```text
    SCRIPT 1:
    IF 0: TR.P 1    => do nothing
    SCRIPT 2        => will pulse output 2

    SCRIPT 2:
    ELSE: TR.P 2    => will not pulse output 2 if called directly,
                       but will if called from script 1

Runs the command every `x` times the line is executed.  This is tracked on a per-line basis, so each script can have 6 different "dividers".

Here is a 1-script clock divider:

```
EVERY 2: TR.P 1
EVERY 4: TR.P 2
EVERY 8: TR.P 3
EVERY 16: TR.P 4

The numbers do _not_ need to be evenly divisible by each other, so there is no problem with:

```
EVERY 2: TR.P 1
EVERY 3: TR.P 2

`OTHER` can be used to do somthing alternately with a preceding `EVERY` or `SKIP` command.

For example, here is a script that alternates between two triggers to make a four-on-the-floor beat with hats between the beats:

```
EVERY 4: TR.P 1
OTHER: TR.P 2

You could add snares on beats 2 and 4 with:

```
SKIP 2: TR.P 3
```
